# parallax_effect

When you scroll a list of cards (containing images, for example) in an app, you might notice that those images appear to scroll more slowly than the rest of the screen. It almost looks as if the cards in the list are in the foreground, but the images themselves sit far off in the distant background. This effect is known as parallax.
